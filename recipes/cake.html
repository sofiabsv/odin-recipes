    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ cup cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>¼ cup cherry jam</li>
      <li>3 cups chocolate buttercream frosting</li>
      <li>14 ounces marzipan</li>
      <li>5 drops red food coloring, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two
        9-inch square cake pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the cake: Sift 2 1/3 cups plus 1 1/2 tablespoons flour, 1/2 cup
        plus 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a
        large bowl. <br>Combine 1 cup plus 1/2 tablespoon milk in a liquid measure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat white sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer
        until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time,
        beating well after each addition. <br>Beat in vanilla. Add flour mixture
        alternately with milk, mixing batter gently between after addition.
        Divide batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then
        invert onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble and decorate the cake: Trim tops of cake layers to make sure
        they are flat. Place one layer onto a serving platter. Spread jam on
        top, then cover with the second layer. <br>Spread chocolate buttercream
        frosting over the top and sides of the cake, reserving about 2
        tablespoons frosting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pinch off a piece of marzipan about the size of a golf ball. Add red
        food coloring and knead until color is evenly distributed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust a flat work surface with confectioners' sugar and roll out
        remaining undyed marzipan. Cut out a 9-inch square; carefully transfer
        to the top of the cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll trimmings of marzipan and cut into four 9x1 1/2-inch strips. Cut
        three rectangular notches into one edge of each strip. <br>Press strips onto
        the sides of the cake, with the notches facing down, then gently press
        the top and strips of marzipan together to adhere.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out red marzipan and cut into squares of varying sizes. Spread a
        little of the reserved frosting on the back of each square to act as a
        glue; arrange in a random Minecraft pattern on top of the cake.
      </li>
    </ol>
