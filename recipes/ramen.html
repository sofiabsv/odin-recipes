    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 instant ramen noodle packet</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 green onion</li>
      <li>1 piece ham</li>
      <li>2.5 cups water</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Prep the ingredients: Hard or soft boil the egg and cut in half, slice
        the green onions, and cut the ham in half.
      </li>
      <li>Boil water in a kettle or on the stove.</li>
      <li>
        Place ramen noodles in a bowl. If your ramen comes with a dry ramen
        seasoning packet, open and put it in now.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour boiling water into the bowl. Cover the bowl and let it sit
        according to the ramen package instructions (3-5 minutes).

        Once cooked uncover and separate noodles using chopsticks or a fork. Mix
        the water, noodles, and seasoning packet together well.

      <li>
        Top with half of the egg, sliced green onion, and both pieces of cut
        ham.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy immediately so the noodles don't get soggy!</li>
    </ol>
